<!-- this is a subheadline -->
My name is Siqi Chen (Alice). I am currently a 3rd year [BCMB](https://bcmb.bs.jhmi.edu) PhD candidate from the [Timp lab](https://www.timplab.org) at Johns Hopkins. I am jointly mentored by [Prof. Winston Timp](https://www.timplab.org/people/) and [Prof. Stephanie Hicks](https://www.stephaniehicks.com). 

Before starting my PhD, I graduated from Vanderbilt University, where I studied synaptic elimination in [_C. elegans_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caenorhabditis_elegans) in the [Miller lab](https://lab.vanderbilt.edu/miller-lab/).
