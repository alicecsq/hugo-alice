# A little about me
Hello! I'm currently a 3rd year BCMB PhD student at JHSoM.

## Training
Before starting my PhD, I graduated from Vanderbilt University, with a dual degree in Applied Mathmatics and Biology. During my undergrad, I studied synaptic elimination in [_C.elegans_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caenorhabditis_elegans) using genetics and imaging approaches in the [Miller lab](https://lab.vanderbilt.edu/miller-lab/). 

I joined the [Timp lab](https://www.timplab.org) in 2021 for my thesis work, where I am interested in developing and applying nanopore sequencing methodologies to explore the spatial and/or cell-type resolved transcriptome of the brain. 

## Research interest
spatial and single-cell transcriptomics, nanopore sequencing methodologies development, epigenetics and cell-fate determination

## Statistics and Programming skills
1. python/R, including using bioconductor packages, e.g. SingleCellExperiment/SpatialExperiment, and genomics tools, e.g.BEDTOOLS
2. bash, and currently learning snakemake
3. statistics, including probability and inference, hypothesis testing, etc

## Three fun facts about me
1. I have two siblings, and I am the youngest.
2. I am very bad at baking, but I keep doing it.
3. I am learning to play keyboard. 

## Something inspiring
I have been listening to the [AssianBossGirl](https://www.asianbossgirl.com) podcast recently, where the hosts will share their stories or perspectives on various aspects of life (e.g. finiance, technology, media, family, and career development, etc). I find it very educational and intriguing!

I am excited to also check out [The Corresponding Author](https://soundcloud.com/the-corresponding-author) podcast that I heard about in this class to learn more about data science in academia.
